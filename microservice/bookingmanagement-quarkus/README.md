# bookingmanagement-quarkus Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```

The application, packaged as an _Ã¼ber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/bookingmanagement-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

## Docker Images

To create docker images from this project, you first need to package the project:

```shell script

```

Now you can create the Docker Image using:
```shell script
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t quarkus/bookingmanagement-quarkus-jvm .
```

After you created the Docker Image, you can run it in a container using:

```shell script
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus/bookingmanagement-quarkus-jvm
```
